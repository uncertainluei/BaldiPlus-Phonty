I had plans of completely reworking the mod (and character) to be more faithful to its source material, which I dropped once I realized that would make the mod less of a direct port of an abandoned port made by someone else unaware and rather an indirect homage to EternityDev, someone who I do not want to support in this day and age.

The source code will still be up for those who just want to port past BB+ 0.11, but do note that I won't be supporting these.
